# SHARKSOðŸ¦ˆIAL System Architecture Overview

## System Philosophy

SHARKSOðŸ¦ˆIAL is built on the principle of **modular flexibility** with **production readiness**. The system uses environment-based toggles to seamlessly switch between mock development services and production-ready implementations.

## Core Architecture Principles

### 1. Separation of Concerns
- **Authentication Module**: Completely isolated from business logic
- **Data Layer**: Abstract interfaces for easy provider switching
- **UI Components**: Reusable, composable React components
- **Service Layer**: Business logic separated from API routes

### 2. Environment-Aware Design
```typescript
// Automatic service selection based on environment
export class AuthServiceFactory {
  static create(): IAuthService {
    if (config.useMock) {
      return new MockAuthService();
    }
    return new ProductionAuthService();
  }
}
