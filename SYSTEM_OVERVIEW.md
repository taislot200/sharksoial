# SHARKSOðŸ¦ˆIAL System Architecture Overview

## System Philosophy

SHARKSOðŸ¦ˆIAL is built on the principle of **modular flexibility** with **production readiness**. The system uses environment-based toggles to seamlessly switch between mock development services and production-ready implementations.

## Core Architecture Principles

### 1. Separation of Concerns
- **Authentication Module**: Completely isolated from business logic
- **Data Layer**: Abstract interfaces for easy provider switching
- **UI Components**: Reusable, composable React components
- **Service Layer**: Business logic separated from API routes

### 2. Environment-Aware Design
```typescript
// Automatic service selection based on environment
export class AuthServiceFactory {
  static create(): IAuthService {
    if (config.useMock) {
      return new MockAuthService();
    }
    return new ProductionAuthService();
  }
}

### Mock Mode (Development)
1. Application starts with `USE_MOCK=true`
2. Services automatically switch to mock implementations
3. Mock data is generated and seeded into the database
4. API calls return simulated data with realistic delays

#### Mock Users for Testing
- **Admin** (admin): System administrator - online
- **à¸ªà¸¡à¸Šà¸²à¸¢ à¹ƒà¸ˆà¸”à¸µ** (somchai): Full-stack developer - online  
- **à¸¡à¸²à¸¥à¸µ à¸ªà¸§à¸¢à¸‡à¸²à¸¡** (malee): UX/UI Designer - offline (30 min ago)

#### Sample Data Includes
- 2 private chats + 1 group chat ("à¸—à¸µà¸¡à¸žà¸±à¸’à¸™à¸² SHARKSOðŸ¦ˆIAL")
- 5 sample messages with Thai content
- Complete friendship connections between all users
